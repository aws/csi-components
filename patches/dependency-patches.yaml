# Quick patching for dependency-only changes
# Versions in this file will be automatically applied followed
# by `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor` during builds
#
# If changes beyond upgrading the version are required, such
# as adjusting function calls, use a full patch file
#
# These changes are applied AFTER the relevant patch folder
# and thus must compose on top of them
